## Hypersonic Flow Modeling
Hypersonic shock wave boundary layer interactions (SWBLI) are a crucial aspect of aerospace engineering, particularly in the design and analysis of high-speed vehicles such as reentry spacecraft and missiles. These interactions occur when a shock wave, generated by the vehicle traveling at hypersonic speeds, impinges on the boundary layer that develops along the vehicle‚Äôs surface. This interaction can lead to complex flow phenomena including boundary layer separation, increased heat transfer, and heightened skin friction, which can significantly affect vehicle stability and thermal loading. Accurate modeling of SWBLI is essential for predicting these effects and ensuring the structural integrity and performance of hypersonic vehicles. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, supported by wind tunnel experiments and advanced turbulence models, play a pivotal role in understanding and mitigating adverse SWBLI effects, enabling safer and more efficient vehicle designs.

## Supersonic Jet Expansion Flows
Supersonic free and impinging jets play a pivotal role in various practical applications, such as vertical short takeoff and landing, jet blast deflectors, turbine blade cooling, lunar landing modules, space launch vehicle systems, electronics cooling, and cold spray coating. The intricate nature of these supersonic jets stems from the simultaneous presence of
multiple shocks, expansion waves, and their interactions with large-scale vortical structures in shear layers. The flow characteristics of underexpanded impinging jets are primarily influenced by the nozzle pressure ratio (NPR), defined as the ratio of stagnation pressure to ambient pressure (ùëÉ‚àû), the nozzle temperature ratio (NTR), the ratio of stagnation temperature to ambient temperature (ùëá‚àû), the nozzle-to-wall distance (‚Ñé), and the jet Mach number (ùëÄùëé). In the case of a convergent nozzle configuration, achieving the sonic condition at the nozzle exit occurs when the NPR equals the critical nozzle pressure ratio of 1.893 for standard air.
Compressible supersonic simulations are conducted to analyze the expansion behavior of turbulent jets under varying NPRs and NTRs.
