    "text": "Hypersonic Flow Modeling\nHypersonic shock wave boundary layer interactions (SWBLI) are a crucial aspect of aerospace engineering, particularly in the design and analysis of high-speed vehicles such as reentry spacecraft and missiles. These interactions occur when a shock wave, generated by the vehicle traveling at hypersonic speeds, impinges on the boundary layer that develops along the vehicle’s surface. This interaction can lead to complex flow phenomena including boundary layer separation, increased heat transfer, and heightened skin friction, which can significantly affect vehicle stability and thermal loading. Accurate modeling of SWBLI is essential for predicting these effects and ensuring the structural integrity and performance of hypersonic vehicles. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, supported by wind tunnel experiments and advanced turbulence models, play a pivotal role in understanding and mitigating adverse SWBLI effects, enabling safer and more efficient vehicle designs.\n          \n            \n          \n\nSpatial variation of the span wise velocities (m/s) at (a) x=0.025~m, (b) x=0.04~m, (c) x=0.05~m, and (d) x=0.064~m constant planes along with (e) the surface heating values (W/m\\(^2\\)) and surface streamlines superimposed with the density gradient magnitude for \\(Re\\) = 374,000(1/m).\n Comparisons of the surface parameters for the unit \\(Re =9.35 \\times 10^4~m^{-1}\\) a) Spatial distribution of the translational temperatures, b) surface heating values (kW/m\\(^2\\)) for the continuum SU2-NEMO 2-D and 3-D solutions for the lowest pressure case, \\(Re = 9.35 \\times 10^4~m^{-1}\\)."
