## Compressible Flows (MANE 4960/6960) (Spring 2024)
This course is tailored as a technical elective for senior and graduate students, offering a comprehensive exploration of compressible flow principles. Throughout the duration of the course,  an extensive range of unique concepts and their real-world applications are thoroughly examined. This will include a detailed analysis of fundamental elements such as the speed of sound and Mach number, isentropic quasi 1-D flow in variable area ducts, converging nozzles, choking phenomena, converging-diverging nozzles, moving shocks, blast waves, shock tubes, Rayleigh flow, Fanno flow, normal and oblique shocks, expansion fans, and other relevant topics that will be revealed, time permitting. Moreover, our focus will extend to the intricate development of potential flow theory under minor disturbances across subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic nonequilibrium flow regimes, with a specific emphasis on its application within the realm of aerothermodynamics. The practical implications of the material will be elucidated within the framework of the professorâ€™s ongoing research, contemporary advancements, and historical context.
